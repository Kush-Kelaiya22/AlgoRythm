# AlgoRythm
This is a collaborative project designed to help participants learn and understand Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using the C++ programming language (C++23 standard). The goal is to foster a deeper understanding of fundamental concepts in computer science while encouraging collaboration and knowledge sharing among contributors.

### Getting Started
To use this project, follow these steps:
- **Use Namespaces**:  
	To avoid naming conflicts, we prefer you to use a uniques namespace prefebrally something that is linked to you github id. This preventrs naming conflicts and ensures that there are no unnecessary overloads on functions and operators and we can smoothly integrate the code. Use the `AlgoRythm` for common untilities and final code, sumbit a pull request first and then only push your code to the main branch.
1. **Clone the Repository**:  
	Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
	```bash
	git clone https://github.com/your-username/AlgoRythm.git
	```

2. **Install Required Libraries**:  
	Ensure you have a C++23-compatible compiler installed (e.g., GCC 13+, Clang 16+, or MSVC with C++23 support). If the project uses any external libraries, refer to the `dependencies` section in the documentation or install them using your package manager. For example:
	```bash
	sudo apt-get install <library-name>  # For Linux
	```
	Alternatively, download and configure the libraries manually using git as follows
	```bash
	git clone https://github.com/Kush-Kelaiya22/AlgoRythm.git
	```

3. **Build and Run**:  
	Compile the code using your preferred build system or IDE. For example, using `g++` with C++23 support:
	To include this project in your own project, ensure you add the `include/` directory to your compiler's include path. For example, if you're compiling a file `your_project.cpp` that uses this library, you can use the following command:

	```bash
	g++ -std=c++23 -I <path of the include files> -o your_project your_project.cpp
	./your_project
	```
	Make sure to adjust the paths based on your project's directory structure.

4. **Test the Setup**:  
	Run the provided test cases or example programs to ensure your setup is working correctly. You can find these in the `tests` or `examples` directory.

### Contribution Guidelines
We welcome contributions from everyone! To get started, please review the [CONTRIBUTION.md](CONTRIBUTION.md) file, which contains detailed guidelines on how to contribute effectively to this project. Whether you're fixing bugs, adding new algorithms, or improving documentation, your contributions are highly valued.

Here are some ways you can contribute:
- Implement new algorithms or data structures.
- Optimize existing code for better performance.
- Write unit tests to improve code reliability.
- Enhance the documentation for better clarity and usability.

### Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
- `src/`: Contains the source code for various algorithms and data structures.
- `include/`: Header files for reusable components.

### License
